# Group Formation Tool

CSCI5308 is in desperate need of tool support and automation before it becomes a core
required course in the MACS program and enrollment jumps from an average of 30 students to
120 students. They need a tool to facilitate the organization of students into groups. The primary functional requirement is the ability
for an instructor to enter a set of criteria for a survey that each student completes on the first
day of class. The answers to each student's survey are used in a backend calculation to form all
of the groups for the course based on the parameters defined by the instructor.
